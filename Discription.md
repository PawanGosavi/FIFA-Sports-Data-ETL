ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a popular method used for data integration and management. It is a process of extracting data from various sources, transforming it into a structured format, and loading it into a data warehouse or another data storage solution. ETL is a critical component of many data integration and business intelligence solutions. It allows organizations to collect, process, and analyze large amounts of data from various sources.

This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of ETL using Python programming language, data frames, and CSV files. The project consists of four main files: utils.py, extracted.py, transformed.py, and loaded.py, and a main.py file that executes the ETL process.

The utils.py file contains utility functions that are used throughout the project, including functions for opening files, creating directories, and getting file metadata. The extracted.py file extracts the desired columns from the source data and saves the extracted data to a CSV file. The transformed.py file transforms the extracted data by converting data types, filtering data based on certain conditions, and sorting data based on specific columns. Finally, the loaded.py file loads the transformed data into a data storage solution.

The main.py file is the entry point of the ETL process. It imports the other files and executes the extracted_data(), transformed_data(), and loaded_data() functions to complete the ETL process.

In conclusion, this project provides a simple yet effective implementation of ETL using Python programming language, data frames, and CSV files. It demonstrates how ETL can be used to extract, transform, and load data from various sources, and how it can help organizations to manage and analyze large amounts of data.
